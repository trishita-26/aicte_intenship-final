# 🌾 AICTE Internship Project – Crop & Fertilizer Recommendation Systems

This project is the outcome of an AICTE internship focused on applying **Machine Learning in Agriculture**. It includes two intelligent systems:

- ✅ **Crop Recommendation System**
- ✅ **Fertilizer Recommendation System**

Both models are trained on real-world agricultural datasets to help farmers make data-driven decisions and improve productivity.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

Farmers often struggle with selecting the right crop and fertilizer due to lack of proper knowledge and environmental awareness. This results in low yield and resource wastage. The goal of this project is to build ML-based systems that recommend:

- The **most suitable crop** based on soil nutrients and weather.
- The **optimal fertilizer** based on the current crop and soil condition.

---

## 🚀 Solution Overview

- 📊 Performed data preprocessing, scaling, and encoding
- 🧠 Trained models using classification algorithms (Random Forest, Decision Tree)
- 📈 Evaluated using accuracy score and confusion matrix
- 🌐 Deployed both models as interactive web apps using **Gradio** and **Hugging Face Spaces**

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **Pandas & NumPy**
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**
- **Gradio**
- **Hugging Face Spaces**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
