# AICTE Internship – Week 2 Project

This repository contains the work completed during **Week 2** of the **AICTE Internship Program**. The focus of this week's task is to build a simple machine learning model that provides **crop recommendations** based on various soil and climate parameters.

## 🌾 Project: Crop Recommendation System

### 🧠 Objective
To develop a machine learning model that suggests the most suitable crop to cultivate based on given environmental features like:
- Nitrogen
- Phosphorus
- Potassium
- Temperature
- Humidity
- pH
- Rainfall

### 🗂️ Contents
- `week_2_aiecte_internship.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `crop recommandation.csv`: Dataset used for training the model.
- `README.md`: This file – project overview and instructions.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

### 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone this repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/trishita-26/aiecte_intenship-week-2.git
   cd aiecte_intenship-week-2
2. Open the notebook:


jupyter notebook week_2_aiecte_internship.ipynb

Run all the cells to train and test the model.

📊 Model Evaluation
The model is evaluated using accuracy metrics and confusion matrix visualization. Further improvements can include:

Hyperparameter tuning

Feature engineering

Deploying the model via a web app (e.g., Flask or Streamlit)

📌 Future Scope
Real-time crop recommendation using user input through a web interface

Integrating weather APIs for dynamic recommendations

Expanding the dataset for better generalization
